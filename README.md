# The Great Outdoor Five Building Types
<!--add your title on the first line above-->
​
add your summary image here, try to make it explanatory of what the tool does, not just what the output looks like. For example, exposure a part of the analysis geometry. An animated GIF can also be used to explain how the tool is working--

#### Description
​
<!--add your description below-->
This is a basic description of the tool that is simple enough that anyone can understand that explains what it does and why someone would use it. Make sure to include the actual metric, for example, % of people with access to a park within 5 min, or % of buildings with good views. Keep it to 3 sentences or less
​
#### How To Use
​
<b>Step by Step Instructions:</b>
1. Link to epw file
2. Right click on "Context" -> Select Multiple and select building obstructions.
3. Right click on "Ground" -> Select Multiple and select ground.
4. Right click on "Ground" -> Select Multiple and select the massing(s) you want to test.
5. Adjust Threshold X,Y,Z
6. Review visual and metric outputs. Does it look correct? Does something look wrong? Common issues below.

#### Modeling Standards
<!--Revise for specific modeling requirements for you analysis to run properly. If useful, add an image of properly vs improperly model geometry-->
<h5>Please follow the following Rhino standards to ensure the proper functionality of the tool:</h5>
<br>
​
<input type="checkbox"> <b>My test massing is a single, simplified, CLOSED polysurface.</b>
  <li>Try "SelClosedSrf" to make sure it is closed.</li>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>My model is oriented to True North.</b>
  <li>Re-orient if it was rotated off of North at the start of the project.</li>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>Any groups or blocks in the model have been ungrouped/exploded.</b>
  <li>Try "SelBlockInstance" and "SelGroup" to make sure.</li>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>My model is set to either Meters or Feet (not mm or in).</b> <br>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>My model is free of overlapping, coplanar, or intersecting geometry.</b><br>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>Any obstructions around the space have been modeled (trees, topography, buildings).</b><br>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>Any curved surfaces in the model have been simplified to individual flat planes.</b><br>
<input type="checkbox"> <b>Any surrounding context has been made into a single, joined mesh.</b>

#### Sources, Calculations + Metrics
<!--add text and/or images for any sources for you metrics, calculations & equations, assumptions and specific metric output-->
This tool uses this method of calculating X from this source. The metric is derived in this manner.

#### Limitations & Context
<!--add text and/or images that expose potential for bias by stating limitations (ie what does this tool not do,) and the context in which it was created.-->
​
This tool does X it does not do Z and Y. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
